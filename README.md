# Desciption

This Lua module provides API funtions to debug Lua programs in the style of `gdb`.

That is, you can add breakpoints to debug your application.

To load `luadebug` module, just write

```lua
local ldb = require "luadebug"
```

# Methods

## setbreakpoint

**syntax:** id = luadebug.setbreakpoint(func, line)

Sets a breakpoint within function `func`, right at the `line` line of source file.

`func` is a function, and `line` is a number which means the line number for setting breakpoint.

If the `line` is out of the range of function definition, returns `nil`; otherwise, the `line`

will be automatically corrected to the nearest activeline (greater than or equal to `line`).

If `line` is not specified, then it will be the smallest activeline by default. 

Returns the breakpoint id when success, otherwise returns `nil`.

The breakpoint `id` can be later used to remove the breakpoint.

## removebreakpoint

**syntax:** luadebug.removebreakpoint(id)

Removes the breakpoint set before. If `id` is not a valid breakpoint id, it does nothing.

## printvarvalue

**syntax:** luadebug.printvarvalue(name, level)

Prints the value of a variable called `name`. The variable can be either a local variable, an upvalue,

or a variable in `_ENV` table. And `level` specifies the stack level of the active function

from which the variable is searched; `1` (the default) means the function where the breakpoint is set.

If the variable is found, then it prints the where the variable is found (local | upvalue | global),

and the value of variable. If not found, it then prompts the variable is not found.

## setvarvalue

**syntax:** luadebug.setvarvalue(name, value, level)

Sets the value of a variable called `name` to `value`. The variable can be either a local variable, an upvalue,

or a variable in `_ENV` table. And `level` specifies the stack level of the active function

from which the variable is searched; `1` (the default) means the function where the breakpoint is set.

If the variable is found, then modifies the value to `value` and prints the where the variable is found (local | upvalue | global).

If not found, it then prompts the variable is not found.

## printtraceback

**syntax:** luadebug.printvarvalue(level)

Prints a traceback of call stack. The parameter `level` (1 by default) tells at which level to start the traceback.
