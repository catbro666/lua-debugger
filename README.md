# Desciption

This Lua module provides API funtions to debug Lua programs in the style of `gdb`.

That is, you can add breakpoints to debug your application.

To load `luadebug` module, just write

```lua
local ldb = require "luadebug"
```

# Methods
## setbreakpoint

**syntax:** id = luadebug.setbreakpoint(func, line)

Set a breakpoint within function `func`, right at the `line` line of source file.

`func` is a function, and `line` is a number which means the line number for setting breakpoint.

Returns the breakpoint id when success, otherwise returns `nil`.

The breakpoint `id` can be later used to remove the breakpoint.

## removebreakpoint

**syntax:** luadebug.removebreakpoint(id)

Remove the breakpoint set before. If `id` is not a valid breakpoint id, it does nothing.

## getvarvalue

**syntax:** luadebug.getvarvalue(name, level)

Print the value of a variable called `name`. And `level` specifies the stack level of the active function

from which the variable is searched.
